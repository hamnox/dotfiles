My dotfiles and first-use setup scripts!

Shouldn't have anything specific to me, as of the commit that added this
readme. As long as you have exactly the same configuration preferences
I do, anyway. If I didn't explain why a setting is set the way it is
to your complete satisfaction, create an issue or otherwise contact me,
and I'll add an explanation.

Usage on linux (will install system packages):

    bin/dotfiles-install

Usage on mac (assuming sufficient set-up):

    bin/dotfiles-install user

Or, just poke through and lift what you like. Have fun!
